# Platon Code

**Platon Code** is Platon’s agent harness control surface — a fork of [T3 Code](https://github.com/pingdotgg/t3code) rebranded and extended for our team.

Drive coding agents (Codex, Claude Code, Cursor, Grok Build, Kimi Code CLI, OpenCode) from web, desktop, and mobile, with remote-ready WebSocket hosting.

Brand marks live under [`assets/platon/`](./assets/platon/) and are applied across web/desktop/mobile icons.

## Installation

> [!WARNING]
> Platon Code currently supports Codex, Claude, Cursor, Grok Build, Kimi Code CLI, and OpenCode. Install and authenticate at least one provider before use:
>
> - Codex: install [Codex CLI](https://developers.openai.com/codex/cli) and run `codex login`
> - Claude: install [Claude Code](https://claude.com/product/claude-code) and run `claude auth login`
> - Cursor: install [Cursor CLI](https://cursor.com/cli) and run `agent login`
> - Grok Build: install [Grok Build CLI](https://x.ai/cli) and run `grok login`
> - Kimi: install [Kimi Code CLI](https://moonshotai.github.io/kimi-code/en/) and run `kimi` then `/login`
> - OpenCode: install [OpenCode](https://opencode.ai) and run `opencode auth login`

### Try it out (install-free)

The easiest way to test Platon Code is to run the server in your terminal (requires Node.js 22.16+, 23.11+, or 24.10+):

```bash
npx t3@latest
```

This will launch Platon Code's backend on your machine as well as the local web app to control your agents.

Tip: Use `npx t3@latest --help` for the full CLI reference.

### Desktop app

Install the latest version of the desktop app from [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/pingdotgg/t3code/releases), or from your favorite package registry:

#### Windows (`winget`)

```bash
winget install T3Tools.T3Code
```

#### macOS (Homebrew)

```bash
brew install --cask t3-code
```

#### Arch Linux (AUR)

```bash
yay -S t3code-bin
```
